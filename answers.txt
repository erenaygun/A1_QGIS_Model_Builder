Assignment 1.1.: Automated GIS Analyses using the QGIS Model Builder

Part 1

With the help of the TWI the role of the local topography for runoff generation can be quantified
(Qin et al. 2011 quoted in Pourali et al. p. 40) and the long term moisture availability for a particular a landscape 
can be revealed (Kopecký and Čížková 2010 quoted in Pourali et al. p. 40).
The use of TWI "in modelling hydrological processes, biological processes, vegetation patterns, and 
studies in forests" (Hjerdt et al. 2004 quoted in Pourali et al. p. 40) have become widespread owing it to the ease, 
with which it can be implemented, to its "simple physically-based principles without depending much on user inputs 
and representing a consistent approach to the parameterisation of water movement 
(Sörensen et al. 2006 quoted in Pourali et al. p. 40). It can be represented with the following formula:
	
				W = ln(a/tanβ)

Where a stands for the upslope catchment area divided by the contour length along with the flow pathway, 
and tanβ shows the steepest downslope direction, W being the TWI. 

2 ) How are the TWI values related to the flood probability?

Flood probabality rises with hiher TWI values. 

Part 2
------------------------------------------------
1) Within GRASS GIS Tools there are three functionalities
"r.topidx", "r.watershed" and "r.terraflow", which calculate the TWI directly. (cf. Mattivi et al. 2019, page 5, figure 4).

2)If the user chooses Whitebox GAT Tools, a cross-platform open source geographic information system in the programming languages
Java and Python,the two tools "Slope" and "SCA" can calculate the TWI (albeit with many intermediate steps).

3) With SAGA GIS, under the section "Terrain Analysis - Hydrology", the tools "Topographic wetness index (twi)" 
can be used in one or more steps as well as the "Saga wetness index" (cf. Mattivi et al. 2019, p.5. Fig.4).
